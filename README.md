Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter.git myproject

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```

Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top picks. From my experience, the easiest way to get started is with **Heroku**. It will automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, has zero-downtime deployments and supports custom domains on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **MongoDB Atlas** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices, and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### 1-Step Deployment with Heroku

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Heroku_logo.png" width="200">

- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In a terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

### Hosted MongoDB Atlas

<img src="https://www.mongodb.com/assets/images/global/MongoDB_Logo_Dark.svg" width="200">

- Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Click the green **Get started free** button
- Fill in your information then hit **Get started free**
- You will be redirected to Create New Cluster page.
- Select a **Cloud Provider and Region** (such as AWS and a free tier region)
- Select cluster Tier to **Free Shared Clusters**
- Give Cluster a name (default: Cluster0)
- Click on green **:zap:Create Cluster button**
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user. To create a new MongoDB user, from the **Clusters view**, select the **Security tab**
- Under the **MongoDB Users** tab, click on **+Add New User**
- Fill in a username and password and give it either **Atlas Admin** User Privilege
- Next, you will need to create an IP address whitelist and obtain the connection URI.  In the Clusters view, under the cluster details (i.e. SANDBOX - Cluster0), click on the **CONNECT** button.
- Under section **(1) Check the IP Whitelist**, click on **ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE**. The form will add a field with `0.0.0.0/0`.  Click **SAVE** to save the `0.0.0.0/0` whitelist.
- Under section **(2) Choose a connection method**, click on **Connect Your Application**
- In the new screen, select **Node.js** as Driver and version **2.2.12 or later**. _*WARNING*_: Do not pick 3.0 or later since connect-mongo can't handle mongodb+srv:// connection strings.
- Finally, copy the URI connection string and replace the URI in MONGODB_URI of `.env.example` with this URI string.  Make sure to replace the <PASSWORD> with the db User password that you created under the Security tab.
- Note that after some of the steps in the Atlas UI, you may see a banner stating `We are deploying your changes`.  You will need to wait for the deployment to finish before using the DB in your application.


**Note:** As an alternative to MongoDB Atlas, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).
